# Animal Shelter Database Management System

This repository contains the project files for an enterprise database management system designed to manage the operations of an animal shelter. Our team chose this project to combine our technical skills with our passion for animal welfare, creating a tool to help streamline the management of shelter animals, staff, and adoption records. This system is developed using PostgreSQL for database management and Java for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Project Overview
This Animal Shelter Database Management System provides a comprehensive solution for managing key shelter operations. The system is hosted on a standalone machine, ensuring secure and dedicated access to shelter data. The Java-based GUI allows for user-friendly interaction, making it accessible for shelter staff, while the PostgreSQL backend handles complex data management tasks.

### Key Features
- **Animal Records Management**: Allows users to add, update, and view detailed records for each animal in the shelter, including health status, breed, and intake information.
- **Adoption Tracking**: Supports tracking the adoption process, managing adopter information, and updating animal statuses upon adoption.
- **Staff and Volunteer Records**: Manages information on shelter employees and volunteers, including contact details, roles, and schedules.

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Programming Language**: Java (for GUI development)

## Motivation
Our team members bring personal experience from working with animals, either as volunteers or as employees in animal-related fields. This project allowed us to leverage that experience to design a practical, well-organized system that addresses the real needs of shelter operations.

## Implementation
- **Backend**: PostgreSQL database setup supports complex queries, relationships, and data integrity to maintain accurate and reliable records.
- **Frontend**: Java GUI provides an intuitive interface, enabling shelter staff to interact with the system easily for everyday tasks.
